# Creation of the small page started, this will contain some of the main visual of the page

- first it will be just some division of the page to contain the different elements of the page. 
    - On the left side we will have a compilation of the chatbot texts
    - and on the right side of the page, we will have a link to the page to display the flowcharts created during the conversation with the chatbox      

- the left panel is divided in sections of text provided at the beginning of the conversation.
    - a middle panel that serves a channel log of the current conversation 
    - and a input button at the bottom of the left panel, this takes the whole width of the left panel
